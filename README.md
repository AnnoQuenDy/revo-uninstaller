> **What is the difference between Setup and Portable versions?** <br>
> The Portable versions of **Revo Uninstaller** and **Revo Registry Cleaner** are non-installable versions that do not store any information in the Windows Registry and can be used on removable drives. <br><br>
> The licensing of **Revo Uninstaller Pro Portable** and **Revo Registry Cleaner Pro Portable** are per user, not per computer. In terms of functionality both versions of the products are identical. <br><br>
> The portable version must be activated after being downloaded, in order to work, as it doesn't have trial period. <br><br>
> <i>Please note that the portable version is not designed to be activated separately on each computer, on which it will be used.</i> <br>
> <i>It is designed to be activated once, then moved to a USB flash drive, and used directly from there on any computer.</i>
